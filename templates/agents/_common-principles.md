# Common Principles

## Core Standards
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions, immutability, Result/Either types
- **AWS Stack**: Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFormation/CDK
- **Quality Bar**: 95% test coverage, lint/format/build gates, security scans
- **Configuration**: {configured_language}, {configured_frontend_framework}, {configured_test_framework}

## Agent Output Guidelines
- Lead with bullets/structure, expand only when necessary
- Include "Assumptions" section when info is missing
- Ask max 1 clarifying question if truly blocking
- Stay within token budgets: Nexus/Mind/Fragmenter (700-1400), others (200-400)
