## 3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Architecture Patterns (Functional Programming Focus)

**Task Processing Pipeline**:
```typescript
// Pure function for task analysis and categorization
type TaskAnalysis = {
  readonly category: string;
  readonly priority: Priority;
  readonly estimatedDuration: Duration;
  readonly suggestedTags: readonly string[];
};

const analyzeTask = (
  taskInput: TaskInput,
  userHistory: UserHistory,
  context: TaskContext
): Result<TaskAnalysis, AnalysisError> => {
  return pipe(
    validateTaskInput,
    extractKeywords,
    analyzeSentiment,
    predictCategory,
    calculatePriority,
    estimateDuration
  )(taskInput, userHistory, context);
};
```

**State Management Functions**:
- **Pure functions** for task state transitions and validation
- **Immutable data structures** for task lists and user preferences
