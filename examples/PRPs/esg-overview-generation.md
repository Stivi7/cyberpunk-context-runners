## 3. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Architecture Patterns (Functional Programming Focus)

**Document Generation Pipeline**:
```typescript
// Pure function for document structure generation
type DocumentSection = {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly content: readonly ContentBlock[];
  readonly metadata: DocumentMetadata;
};

const generateESGDocument = (
  companyData: CompanyData,
  esgScores: ESGScores,
  measures: readonly Measure[]
): Result<DocumentStructure, GenerationError> => {
  return pipe(
    validateInputData,
    createDocumentSections,
    applyBrandingTheme,
    formatForExport
  )(companyData, esgScores, measures);
};
```

**Content Processing Functions**:
- **Pure functions** for score calculations and comparisons
- **Immutable data structures** for document content management
- **Function composition** for content transformation pipeline
- **Result types** for error handling throughout generation process

### AWS Services Needed

**Core Infrastructure**:
- **AWS Lambda**: Document generation engine and content processing
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Store document templates, branding assets, and generation metadata
- **Amazon S3**: Asset storage for logos, images, and generated document cache
- **Amazon API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for document generation requests

**Integration Services**:
- **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrate multi-step document generation workflow
- **Amazon SQS**: Queue management for high-volume document generation requests
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Configuration management for ESRS mappings and templates

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Performance monitoring and error tracking
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for generation pipeline debugging

### Frontend Framework Choice: React

**Rationale for React Selection**:
- **Existing Integration**: Seamless integration with current strategy UI React codebase
- **Component Reusability**: Leverage existing UI components for consistency
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Rich ecosystem for document preview and Google integration
- **Team Expertise**: Development team's existing React proficiency

**Key React Implementation Patterns**:
- **Functional components** with hooks for state management
- **React Query** for server state and caching of generated documents
- **Context API** for global document generation state
- **Suspense boundaries** for loading states during generation

### Performance and Scalability Requirements

**Generation Performance**:
- Document generation completion within 5 seconds for standard complexity
- Support for concurrent generation of up to 50 documents
- Memory usage optimization for large ESG datasets (>1000 measures)

**Scalability Targets**:
- Handle 1000+ document generations per day
- Auto-scaling capabilities for peak usage periods
- 99.9% uptime during business hours (6 AM - 8 PM CET)

**Caching Strategy**:
- Redis caching for frequently accessed company branding assets
- CloudFront CDN for static template resources
- Lambda@Edge for region-specific content optimization
